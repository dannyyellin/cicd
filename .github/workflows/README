Guide to the workflows in this directory.
All the workflows involve the very simple rest-word-svr python program, which is a very simple REST server.
1. build-and-push-v2.yml   This work workflow is triggered by a push event to the repo.   It then builds the image
    based on the Dockerfile, and then pushes it to Dockerfile.  It pushes one with the tag "latest" and one with the tag
    <date>, where <date> = today's date.
2. pull-and-test-image-v2.yml    This workflow is triggered by the event of "build-and-push-v2.yml" completing
    successfully.   If it has, then there is a new image in Dockerhub.   It pulls down that image and tests it using
    curl commands.
3. build-test-push-v3.yml    This workflow is triggered by a push event to the repo.   It builds the image and uploads
    it to DockerHub.  Then it downloads the image from DockerHub, tests it using pytest, and uploads the results of the
    tests so they are visible after the workflow completes.
4.  build-test-push-v4.yml    This workflow is similar to build-test-push-v3.yml.   However, it does things better and
    more realistically:   it is also triggered by a push event to the repo.  It then builds the image.  But instead of
    pushing it to Dockerhub, it uploads it to GitHub.  The next job in the workload downloads the image from GitHub and
    tests it using pytest.   It uploads the test results to be accessible after the workflow completes.   if the tests
    are successful, it pushes the image to DockerHub.   It actually pushes the image tagged with "latest" and tagged
    with <date>.

5.  build-and-push-simple.yml     This is mostly the same as build-and-push with updates to version numbers of GitHub
    actions and using toys REST program example instead of word server.
